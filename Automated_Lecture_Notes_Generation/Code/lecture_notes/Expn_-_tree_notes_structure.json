It is a variant of the binary tree data structure, where each node represents an operand or an operator. The tree is constructed by scanning a postfix expression, one symbol at a time, and creating a new node for each operand or operator.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Expression Tree:** A data structure used to represent mathematical expressions in a tree-like structure.\n* **Postfix Expression:** A type of expression where the operator follows the operands.\n* **Immutable:** Once an expression tree is constructed, it cannot be modified. To change the expression, another tree must be constructed.\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n\u2022 The expression tree is built by scanning a postfix expression, one symbol at a time.\n\u2022 When an operand is received, a new node is created, which will be a leaf in the expression tree.\n\u2022 When an operator is received, it connects to two leaves.\n\u2022 The stack data structure is used as an intermediary storing place for node addresses.\n\u2022 The tree is constructed by repeatedly creating new nodes, connecting them, and pushing their addresses onto the stack.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider the postfix expression \"abc*+\". The expression tree construction process can be demonstrated as follows:\n\n1. Receive the symbol \"a\" and create a new node with address 100. Push the address onto the stack.\n2. Receive the symbol \"b\" and create a new node with address 150. Push the address onto the stack.\n3. Receive the symbol \"c\" and create a new node with address 300. Push the address onto the stack.\n4. Receive the symbol \"*\" and create a new node with address 250. Pop the address of node 300 from the stack and make it the right child of the new node. Pop the address of node 150 from the stack and make it the left child of the new node. Push the address of the new node onto the stack.\n5. Receive the symbol \"+\" and create a new node with address 400. Pop the address of node 250 from the stack and make it the right child of the new node. Pop the address of node 100 from the stack and make it the left child of the new node. Push the address of the new node onto the stack.\n\nThe resulting expression tree has the root node with address 400, and the leaf nodes with addresses 100, 150, and 300."

It is constructed from a postfix expression, where the operands are evaluated first, and then the operators are applied.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Postfix Expression:** A postfix expression is a string of symbols where operators follow their operands. For example, the postfix expression \"abc*+\" represents the expression \"a * (b + c)\".\n* **Expression Tree:** An expression tree is a binary tree that represents a mathematical expression. It is constructed from a postfix expression, where the operands are evaluated first, and then the operators are applied.\n\n**Construction of Expression Tree:**\n\nThe construction of an expression tree involves the following steps:\n\n* Scan the postfix expression till the end, one symbol at a time.\n* Create a new node with the symbol as info and left and right links as NULL.\n* If the symbol is an operand, push the address of the node to the stack.\n* If the symbol is an operator:\n\t+ Pop the address from the stack and make it the right child of the new node.\n\t+ Pop the address from the stack and make it the left child of the new node.\n\t+ Now push the address of the new node to the stack.\n* Finally, the stack has only one element, which is the address of the root of the expression tree.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we have the postfix expression \"abc*+\". We can construct the expression tree as follows:\n\n* Create a new node with the symbol \"a\" as info and left and right links as NULL.\n* Push the address of the node to the stack.\n* Create a new node with the symbol \"*\" as info and left and right links as NULL.\n* Pop the address from the stack and make it the right child of the new node.\n* Pop the address from the stack and make it the left child of the new node.\n* Create a new node with the symbol \"+\" as info and left and right links as NULL.\n* Pop the address from the stack and make it the right child of the new node.\n* Pop the address from the stack and make it the left child of the new node.\n* Push the address of the new node to the stack.\n* Finally, the stack has only one element, which is the address of the root of the expression tree.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\nThe algorithm for constructing an expression tree from a postfix expression is as follows:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack.\n2. Scan the postfix expression till the end, one symbol at a time.\n3. If the symbol is an operand, push the address of the node to the stack.\n4. If the symbol is an operator:\n\t+ Pop the address from the stack and make it the right child of the new node.\n\t+ Pop the address from the stack and make it the left child of the new node.\n\t+ Now push the address of the new node to the stack.\n5. Finally, the stack has only one element, which is the address of the root of the expression tree.\n\n**Example Code:**\n\nThe following is an example code in C++ that constructs an expression tree from a postfix expression:\n```c\n#include <iostream>\n#include <stack>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct Node {\n    char info;\n    Node* left;\n    Node* right;\n};\n\nNode* constructExpressionTree(char* postfixExpression) {\n    stack<Node*> nodeStack;\n    Node* root = NULL;\n\n    for (int i = 0; postfixExpression[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        if (postfixExpression[i] == ' ') {\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (postfixExpression[i] == '+' || postfixExpression[i] == '*' || postfixExpression[i] == '-') {\n            Node* rightChild = nodeStack.top();\n            nodeStack.pop();\n            Node* leftChild = nodeStack.top();\n            nodeStack.pop();\n            Node* newNode = new Node();\n            newNode->info = postfixExpression[i];\n            newNode->left = leftChild;\n            newNode->right = rightChild;\n            nodeStack.push(newNode);\n        } else {\n            Node* newNode = new Node();\n            newNode->info = postfixExpression[i];\n            newNode->left = NULL;\n            newNode->right = NULL;\n            nodeStack.push(newNode);\n        }\n    }\n\n    root = nodeStack.top();\n    nodeStack.pop();\n\n    return root;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    char* postfixExpression = \"abc*+\";\n    Node* root = constructExpressionTree(postfixExpression);\n\n    // Evaluate the expression tree\n    int result = evaluateExpressionTree(root);\n\n    cout << \"Result: \" << result << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint evaluateExpressionTree(Node* node) {\n    if (node == NULL) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    if (node->info == '+') {\n        return evaluateExpressionTree(node->left) + evaluateExpressionTree(node->right);\n    } else if (node->info == '*') {\n        return evaluateExpressionTree(node->left) * evaluateExpressionTree(node->right);\n    } else {\n        return node->info - '0';\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code constructs an expression tree from a postfix expression and evaluates the expression tree using a recursive function."

In this example, we would evaluate the tree as follows:\n\n* Start at the root node \"+\" and apply it to its left child \"2\" and right child \"3\" to get \"5\".\n* Move to the next node \"+\" and apply it to its left child \"5\" and right child \"9\" to get \"14\".\n* Move to the next node \"+\" and apply it to its left child \"14\" and right child \"4\" to get \"18\".\n\nThe final evaluated value is 18."
