Node Structure for Threaded Binary Search Tree**\n\nA Threaded Binary Search Tree (TBT) is a binary search tree where each node has three pointers: left child, right child, and thread.

      "content": "**3. Implementation of Threaded Binary Search Tree**\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe implementation of a Threaded Binary Search Tree (TBT) involves modifying the traditional Binary Search Tree (BST) to utilize the right and/or left pointers to store the inorder successor and/or predecessor, respectively. This allows for the elimination of the explicit stack required for iterative inorder traversal.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n* **Right-In Threaded Binary Tree**: A TBT where the right pointer of a node points to the inorder successor if it is not pointing to a child.\n* **Left-In Threaded Binary Tree**: A TBT where the left pointer of a node stores the inorder predecessor.\n* **In Threaded Binary Tree**: A TBT where both the right and left pointers are used to store the inorder successor and predecessor, respectively.\n\n**Implementation**\n\n* **Set Write Function**:\n\t+ Accepts two pointers: `node` and `new_node`.\n\t+ Checks if `p` is the right child of its parent and has a right thread.\n\t+ If `p` has a right child, returns without modifying the tree.\n\t+ If `p` is a right thread, sets `p`'s right child to `new_node` and sets `new_node`'s right thread to 0.\n\t+ If `p` is not a right thread, sets `p`'s right child to `new_node` and sets `new_node`'s right thread to 1.\n* **Traversal**:\n\t+ Creates two temporary pointers: `P` and `Q`.\n\t+ Sets `P` to the root of the tree.\n\t+ Traverses the tree as long as there are nodes to be printed.\n\t+ Initially, `Q` is set to null.\n\t+ In each iteration:\n\t\t- Traverses left subtree of `P`.\n\t\t- When `P` becomes null, prints the information of `Q` if it is not null.\n\t\t- Sets `P` to the right child of `Q`.\n\t\t- Repeats the process until `P` becomes null.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose we have a TBT with the following nodes:\n\n* 65\n* 62\n* 78\n* 56\n* 63\n* 58\n\nTo traverse this tree using the set write function and traversal algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize `P` to the root node (65) and `Q` to null.\n2. Traverse the left subtree of `P` until `P` becomes null.\n3. Print the information of `Q` (65) and set `P` to the right child of `Q` (62).\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until `P` becomes null.\n5. Print the information of `Q` (62) and set `P` to the right child of `Q` (78).\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until `P` becomes null.\n\nThe traversal order is: 56, 62, 63, 65, 58, 78."

      "content": "**4. Creating the Root Node**\n\nIn a Threaded Binary Search Tree (Threaded BST), the root node is the starting point of the traversal. The root node is created by initializing a tree object and setting its root to null. This section will discuss the creation of the root node and the subsequent traversal process.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Threaded BST:** A binary tree where the right pointer of a node points to the inorder successor if it is not pointing to a child, and the left pointer stores the inorder predecessor.\n* **Root Node:** The starting point of the traversal in a Threaded BST.\n\n**Creating the Root Node:**\n\nTo create the root node, the following steps are followed:\n\n* Initialize a tree object and set its root to null.\n* Create a new node with the desired information (e.g., key, value).\n* Set the root node to the newly created node.\n* Initialize a pointer, p, to the root node.\n* Initialize a pointer, q, to null.\n\n**Traversal Process:**\n\nThe traversal process begins with the root node and continues until the entire tree is traversed. The process involves the following steps:\n\n* While p is not null:\n\t+ If q is a right thread, print p's information and move p to the right child.\n\t+ If q is not a right thread, set q to p and move p to the left child.\n* While q is not null:\n\t+ Print q's information.\n\t+ Set q to null and move p to the left child.\n* Once p and q are both null, the traversal is complete.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we have a threaded binary tree with the following nodes:\n\n* 55\n* 40\n* 78\n* 62\n* 89\n* 30\n\nThe traversal process would begin with the root node (55) and continue as follows:\n\n* Print 55's information.\n* Move p to the right child (40).\n* Since q is a right thread, print 40's information.\n* Move p to the right child (78).\n* Since q is a right thread, print 78's information.\n* Move p to the right child (62).\n* Since q is not a right thread, set q to p and move p to the left child.\n* Print 62's information.\n* Set q to null and move p to the left child.\n* Continue the traversal until the entire tree is traversed.\n\n**Code:**\n\nThe following code demonstrates the creation of the root node and the traversal process:\n```c\nvoid createRoot(Node* root) {\n    root = new Node();\n    root->key = 55;\n    root->left = null;\n    root->right = null;\n    root->right_thread = true;\n}\n\nvoid traverse(Node* p, Node* q) {\n    while (p != null) {\n        if (q->right_thread) {\n            printf(\"%d \", p->key);\n            p = p->right;\n        } else {\n            q = p;\n            p = p->left;\n        }\n    }\n    while (q != null) {\n        printf(\"%d \", q->key);\n        q = null;\n    }\n}\n```\nNote that this code is a simplified example and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of your implementation."

Find the correct position for F in the tree (between B and C)\n2. Insert F as the right child of B\n3. Update the right pointer of F to point to the inorder successor (C)\n4. Update the left pointer of F to point to the inorder predecessor (B)\n\nThe resulting TBT would be:\n\nA (root)\nB (left child of A)\nC (left child of B)\nD (right child of B)\nE (right child of A)\nF (right child of B)\n\nNote that the threaded pointers have been updated to maintain the correct threaded structure."
