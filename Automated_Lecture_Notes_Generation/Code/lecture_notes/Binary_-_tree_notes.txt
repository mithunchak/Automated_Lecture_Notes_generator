### 1. Introduction to Binary Tree Traversals

**1. Introduction to Binary Tree Traversals**

In this section, we will explore the concept of binary tree traversals, which is a crucial operation in binary trees. A binary tree traversal is a process of moving through all the nodes in a binary tree and visiting each one in turn.

**Definition of Key Concepts**

* **Traversal**: Moving through all the nodes in a binary tree and visiting each one in turn.
* **Node**: A single element in the binary tree, which can have a value and pointers to its left and right child nodes.
* **Left subtree**: The set of nodes that are the left child nodes of a node.
* **Right subtree**: The set of nodes that are the right child nodes of a node.
* **Root node**: The topmost node in the binary tree.

**Important Points**

* There are many orders possible in binary tree traversal since it is a nonlinear data structure.
* The three basic tasks involved in binary tree traversal are:
	+ Visiting a node (denoted by V)
	+ Traversing the left subtree (denoted by L)
	+ Traversing the right subtree (denoted by R)
* There are six ways to arrange these tasks: VLR, LVR, LRV, VRL, RVL, RLV

**Standard Traversals**

* **Preorder Traversal**: Root node is visited before the subtrees, and then the left and right subtrees are traversed in preorder.
* **Inorder Traversal**: Left subtree is traversed in inorder, then the root node is visited, and finally the right subtree is traversed in inorder.
* **Postorder Traversal**: Left subtree is traversed in postorder, then the right subtree is traversed in postorder, and finally the root node is visited.

**Example**

Consider the binary tree shown in the slides:

F
B
G
I
D
C
E
A
H

The preorder traversal of this tree is: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H

The inorder traversal of this tree is: F, B, A, C, D, E, G, H, I

The postorder traversal of this tree is: F, G, I, H, E, D, C, B, A

### 2. Types of Binary Tree Traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)

**2. Types of Binary Tree Traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)**

**Preorder Traversal**

* Definition: Visiting the root node before traversing the subtrees.
* Steps:
	+ Root Node is visited before the subtrees.
	+ Left subtree is traversed in preorder.
	+ Right subtree is traversed in preorder.
* Example: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H, F, B, A, D, C, E, G, I, H

**Inorder Traversal**

* Definition: Visiting the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
* Steps:
	+ Left subtree is traversed in inorder.
	+ Root Node is visited.
	+ Right subtree is traversed in inorder.
* Example: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I

**Postorder Traversal**

* Definition: Visiting the left subtree and right subtree before the root node.
* Steps:
	+ Left subtree is traversed in postorder.
	+ Right subtree is traversed in postorder.
	+ Root Node is visited.
* Example: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H, A, C, E, D, B, H, I, G, F

**Important Points**

* In preorder traversal, the root node is visited before the subtrees.
* In inorder traversal, the left subtree is visited before the root node, and the right subtree is visited after the root node.
* In postorder traversal, the left and right subtrees are visited before the root node.
* These traversal methods can be used to perform various operations on a binary tree, such as printing the tree, searching for a specific node, or inserting a new node.

### 3. Preorder Traversal

**3. Preorder Traversal**

Preorder traversal is a type of traversal in a binary tree where the root node is visited before its subtrees. This traversal is also known as VLR (Visit, Left, Right) or "Depth-First Traversal" (DFT).

**Key Concepts:**

* **Preorder Traversal:** A traversal in a binary tree where the root node is visited before its subtrees.
* **VLR:** Visit, Left, Right, the order in which the nodes are visited during preorder traversal.

**Important Points:**

* In preorder traversal, the root node is visited first.
* The left subtree is traversed in preorder.
* The right subtree is traversed in preorder.
* The order of traversal is: Root -> Left -> Right.

**Example:**

Consider the binary tree shown below:

F
B
G
I
D
C
E
A
H

The preorder traversal of this tree would be:

F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H

**Algorithm:**

1. Visit the root node.
2. Traverse the left subtree in preorder.
3. Traverse the right subtree in preorder.

**Example Code:**

```
preorderTraversal(root) {
  if (root == null) return;
  print(root.data); // Visit the root node
  preorderTraversal(root.left); // Traverse the left subtree
  preorderTraversal(root.right); // Traverse the right subtree
}
```

**Note:**

Preorder traversal is often used to create a copy of the binary tree or to perform operations on the tree that require visiting the root node first.

### 4. Inorder Traversal

**4. Inorder Traversal**

**Definition:** Inorder traversal is a type of traversal in a binary tree where the left subtree is traversed, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.

**Steps:**

* Left subtree is traversed in inorder
* Root Node is visited
* Right subtree is traversed in inorder

**Key Points:**

• The inorder traversal visits the nodes in ascending order.
• The traversal starts at the root node and moves to the leftmost node, then backtracks to the root and moves to the rightmost node.
• The traversal continues until all nodes have been visited.

**Algorithm:**

```
iterativeInorder(root)
  s = emptyStack
  current = root
  do {
    while(current != null) {
      // Travel down left branches as far as possible
      s.push(current)
      current = current.left
    }
    // Backtrack and visit the root node
    current = s.pop()
    print(current.info)
    // Move to the right subtree
    current = current.right
  } while(current != null)
```

**Example:**

Suppose we have the following binary tree:

```
       5
     /   \
    3     6
   / \   / \
  2   4 1   7
```

The inorder traversal would visit the nodes in the following order:

```
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```

**Important Notes:**

• The iterative inorder traversal uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to be visited.
• The traversal starts at the root node and moves to the leftmost node, then backtracks to the root and moves to the rightmost node.
• The traversal continues until all nodes have been visited.

By following these steps and using the algorithm, we can perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree and visit the nodes in ascending order.

### 5. Postorder Traversal

**5. Postorder Traversal**

**Definition:** Postorder traversal is a type of traversal in which the left subtree is traversed first, followed by the right subtree, and finally the root node is visited.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Postorder traversal**: A type of traversal in which the left subtree is traversed first, followed by the right subtree, and finally the root node is visited.
* **Stack**: A data structure used to store nodes to be visited in the traversal.
* **Two stacks**: In the iterative postorder traversal algorithm, two stacks (s1 and s2) are used to store nodes to be visited.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize two stacks, s1 and s2, to empty.
2. Push the root node onto s1.
3. While s1 is not empty, do the following:
	* Pop the top node from s1 and push it onto s2.
	* If the popped node has a left child and it is not null, push it onto s1.
	* If the popped node has a right child and it is not null, push it onto s1.
4. While s2 is not empty, pop the top node from s2 and print its value.

**Example:**

Suppose we have the following binary tree:
```
      5
     / \
    3   6
   / \   \
  2   4   1
```
The iterative postorder traversal algorithm would work as follows:

1. Initialize s1 and s2 to empty.
2. Push 5 onto s1.
3. Pop 5 from s1 and push it onto s2.
4. Push 3 onto s1.
5. Pop 3 from s1 and push it onto s2.
6. Push 2 onto s1.
7. Pop 2 from s1 and push it onto s2.
8. Push 4 onto s1.
9. Pop 4 from s1 and push it onto s2.
10. Pop 3 from s2 and print its value (3).
11. Pop 6 from s1 and push it onto s2.
12. Pop 1 from s1 and push it onto s2.
13. While s2 is not empty, pop the top node from s2 and print its value:
	* 1
	* 4
	* 2
	* 6
	* 3
	* 5

The output of the iterative postorder traversal algorithm would be: 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 5.

**Important Points:**

* The iterative postorder traversal algorithm uses two stacks, s1 and s2, to store nodes to be visited.
* The algorithm pushes the root node onto s1 and then repeatedly pops nodes from s1, pushes them onto s2, and pushes their children onto s1 until s1 is empty.
* Finally, the algorithm pops nodes from s2 and prints their values in the order they were visited.

### 6. Iterative Inorder Traversal

**6. Iterative Inorder Traversal**

**Definition:** Iterative Inorder Traversal is a method of traversing a binary tree in an inorder manner, without using recursion.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Stack:** A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, used to store nodes to be visited.
* **Current Node:** The current node being processed.
* **Left and Right Children:** The left and right child nodes of the current node.

**Algorithm:**

* `iterativeInorder(root)`
	+ `s = emptyStack`
	+ `current = root`
	+ `do`
		- `while(current != null)`
			- `push` `current` to `s`
			- `current = current.left`
		- `while(!s.isEmpty())`
			- `pop` `current` from `s`
			- `print` `current.value`
			- `current = current.right`

**Important Points:**

* The algorithm uses a stack to store nodes to be visited.
* The stack is initialized with the root node.
* The algorithm traverses the left subtree of the current node, and then the right subtree.
* The algorithm prints the value of the current node after visiting the right subtree.
* The algorithm continues until the stack is empty.

**Example:**

Suppose we have the following binary tree:

```
     5
    / \
   3   6
  / \   \
 2   4   8
```

The iterative inorder traversal of this tree would be:

1. Initialize the stack and set the current node to the root node (5).
2. Push the root node to the stack and set the current node to its left child (3).
3. Push the left child node to the stack and set the current node to its left child (2).
4. Push the left child node to the stack and set the current node to its left child (null).
5. Pop the top node from the stack (2) and print its value (2).
6. Set the current node to its right child (4).
7. Push the right child node to the stack and set the current node to its left child (null).
8. Pop the top node from the stack (4) and print its value (4).
9. Set the current node to its right child (null).
10. Pop the top node from the stack (3) and print its value (3).
11. Set the current node to its right child (6).
12. Push the right child node to the stack and set the current node to its left child (null).
13. Pop the top node from the stack (6) and print its value (6).
14. Set the current node to its right child (8).
15. Push the right child node to the stack and set the current node to its left child (null).
16. Pop the top node from the stack (8) and print its value (8).
17. The stack is empty, so the algorithm terminates.

The output of the iterative inorder traversal is: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.
