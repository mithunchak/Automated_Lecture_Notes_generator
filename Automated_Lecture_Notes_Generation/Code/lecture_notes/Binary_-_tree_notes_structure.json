A binary tree traversal is a process of moving through all the nodes in a binary tree and visiting each one in turn.\n\n**Definition of Key Concepts**\n\n* **Traversal**: Moving through all the nodes in a binary tree and visiting each one in turn.\n* **Node**: A single element in the binary tree, which can have a value and pointers to its left and right child nodes.\n* **Left subtree**: The set of nodes that are the left child nodes of a node.\n* **Right subtree**: The set of nodes that are the right child nodes of a node.\n* **Root node**: The topmost node in the binary tree.\n\n**Important Points**\n\n* There are many orders possible in binary tree traversal since it is a nonlinear data structure.\n* The three basic tasks involved in binary tree traversal are:\n\t+ Visiting a node (denoted by V)\n\t+ Traversing the left subtree (denoted by L)\n\t+ Traversing the right subtree (denoted by R)\n* There are six ways to arrange these tasks: VLR, LVR, LRV, VRL, RVL, RLV\n\n**Standard Traversals**\n\n* **Preorder Traversal**: Root node is visited before the subtrees, and then the left and right subtrees are traversed in preorder.\n* **Inorder Traversal**: Left subtree is traversed in inorder, then the root node is visited, and finally the right subtree is traversed in inorder.\n* **Postorder Traversal**: Left subtree is traversed in postorder, then the right subtree is traversed in postorder, and finally the root node is visited.\n\n**Example**\n\nConsider the binary tree shown in the slides:\n\nF\nB\nG\nI\nD\nC\nE\nA\nH\n\nThe preorder traversal of this tree is: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H\n\nThe inorder traversal of this tree is: F, B, A, C, D, E, G, H, I\n\nThe postorder traversal of this tree is: F, G, I, H, E, D, C, B, A"

Types of Binary Tree Traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)**\n\n**Preorder Traversal**\n\n* Definition: Visiting the root node before traversing the subtrees.\n* Steps:\n\t+ Root Node is visited before the subtrees.\n\t+ Left subtree is traversed in preorder.\n\t+ Right subtree is traversed in preorder.\n* Example: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H, F, B, A, D, C, E, G, I, H\n\n**Inorder Traversal**\n\n* Definition: Visiting the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.\n* Steps:\n\t+ Left subtree is traversed in inorder.\n\t+ Root Node is visited.\n\t+ Right subtree is traversed in inorder.\n* Example: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I\n\n**Postorder Traversal**\n\n* Definition: Visiting the left subtree and right subtree before the root node.\n* Steps:\n\t+ Left subtree is traversed in postorder.\n\t+ Right subtree is traversed in postorder.\n\t+ Root Node is visited.\n* Example: F, B, G, I, D, C, E, A, H, A, C, E, D, B, H, I, G, F\n\n**Important Points**\n\n* In preorder traversal, the root node is visited before the subtrees.\n* In inorder traversal, the left subtree is visited before the root node, and the right subtree is visited after the root node.\n* In postorder traversal, the left and right subtrees are visited before the root node.\n* These traversal methods can be used to perform various operations on a binary tree, such as printing the tree, searching for a specific node, or inserting a new node."

Visit the root node.\n2. Traverse the left subtree in preorder.\n3. Traverse the right subtree in preorder.\n\n**Example Code:**\n\n```\npreorderTraversal(root) {\n  if (root == null) return;\n  print(root.data); // Visit the root node\n  preorderTraversal(root.left); // Traverse the left subtree\n  preorderTraversal(root.right); // Traverse the right subtree\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\nPreorder traversal is often used to create a copy of the binary tree or to perform operations on the tree that require visiting the root node first."
