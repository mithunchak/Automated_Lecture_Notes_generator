### 1. Definition of Heap

**Section 1: Definition of Heap**

A heap is a specialized binary tree that satisfies two fundamental requirements: the shape requirement and the parental dominance requirement.

**Shape Requirement:**

* A binary tree is considered complete if all its levels are full except possibly the last level, where only some rightmost leaves may be missing.

**Parental Dominance Requirement:**

* The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children.

**Definition of Heap:**

* A heap can be defined as a binary tree with keys assigned to its nodes (one key per node) provided the following two conditions are met:
	+ The tree's shape requirement is satisfied.
	+ The parental dominance requirement is satisfied.

**Example:**

* A binary tree is not considered a heap if it does not satisfy the shape requirement. For instance, the topmost binary tree in Slide 4 is not a heap because it does not meet the shape requirement.
* A binary tree is not considered a heap if it does not satisfy the parental dominance requirement. For instance, the topmost binary tree in Slide 4 is not a heap because it does not meet the parental dominance requirement.

**Properties of Heap:**

* There exists exactly one essentially complete binary tree with n nodes. Its height is equal to ⌊log2n⌋.
* The root of a heap always contains its largest element.
* A node of a heap considered with all its descendants is also a heap.
* A heap can be implemented as an array by recording its elements in the top-down, left-to-right fashion.

**Representation of Heap:**

* In such a representation, the parental node keys will be in the first ⌊n/2⌋ positions of the array.

### 2. Properties of Heap

**Properties of Heap**

A heap is a binary tree that satisfies two conditions:

* **Shape Requirement**: The tree is essentially complete, meaning all levels are full except possibly the last level, where only some rightmost leaves may be missing.
* **Parental Dominance Requirement**: The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children. This condition is automatically satisfied for all leaves.

**Key Properties of Heap**

• **Uniqueness**: There exists exactly one essentially complete binary tree with n nodes. Its height is equal to ⌊log2n⌋.
• **Root Property**: The root of a heap always contains its largest element.
• **Heap Property**: A node of a heap considered with all its descendants is also a heap.
• **Array Implementation**: A heap can be implemented as an array by recording its elements in the top-down, left-to-right fashion. It is convenient to store the heap's elements in positions 1 through n of such an array, leaving H[0] either unused or putting there a sentinel whose value is greater than every element in the heap.

**Array Representation of Heap**

• In such a representation, the parental node keys will be in the first ⌊n/2⌋ positions of the array.
• Leaf nodes will be in the last ⌊n/2⌋ positions of the array.

Note: ⌊⌋ denotes the floor function, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input value.

### 3. Implementation of Heap

**3. Implementation of Heap**

**Definition:** A heap is a binary tree with keys assigned to its nodes, satisfying the following two conditions:

* **Shape Requirement:** The binary tree is essentially complete, meaning all levels are full except possibly the last level, where only some rightmost leaves may be missing.
* **Parental Dominance Requirement:** The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children.

**Properties of Heap:**

• There exists exactly one essentially complete binary tree with n nodes, with a height equal to ⌊log2n⌋.
• The root of a heap always contains its largest element.
• A node of a heap considered with all its descendants is also a heap.
• A heap can be implemented as an array by recording its elements in the top-down, left-to-right fashion.

**Implementation of Heap:**

The implementation of a heap involves rearranging a given sequence of elements to form a descending heap. This is done by comparing each node with its children and swapping them if necessary, to ensure the parental dominance requirement is satisfied.

**Algorithm:**

1. Start with the root node (k = 4) and compare it with its children.
2. If the root node has only one child, compare it with that child and ensure the parental dominance requirement is satisfied.
3. If the root node has two children, compare them and determine which one has a higher value. Swap the root node with the child having the higher value.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each node in the tree, working from top to bottom and left to right.
5. Once the heap is constructed, the array will contain the elements in a descending heap order.

**Example:**

Initially, the array contains the elements:

37, 33, 48, 12, 57, 25, 92, 86

After implementing the heap, the array becomes:

92, 57, 86, 37, 33, 48, 25, 12

**Note:** The heap is constructed by rearranging the elements to satisfy the parental dominance requirement, ensuring that each node is greater than or equal to its children.

### 4. Heap Construction - Bottom Up

**4. Heap Construction - Bottom Up**

**Definition:** Bottom-up heap construction is a method of constructing a heap from a given array of elements. It starts from the last non-leaf node and moves up to the root node, ensuring that the heap property is satisfied at each step.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Heap Property:** The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children.
* **Parental Node:** A node that has children.
* **Left Child:** The left child of a node is at position 2k, where k is the parent node's position.
* **Right Child:** The right child of a node is at position 2k+1, where k is the parent node's position.

**Algorithm:**

1. Start from the last non-leaf node (n/2) and move up to the root node (1).
2. For each node, check if it has a left child (2k <= n) and a right child (2k+1 <= n).
3. If the node has a left child and a right child, compare the values at positions k and j (left child and right child, respectively).
4. If the value at position k is greater than the value at position j, set the heap property as true.
5. If the value at position k is not greater than the value at position j, swap the values at positions k and j.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the root node is reached.

**Formula:** The height of the heap (h) is equal to ⌊log2n⌋.

**Example:** Given an array of elements 18, 20, 25, 18, and 25, construct a heap using the bottom-up approach.

* Start from the last non-leaf node (n/2 = 2).
* Compare the values at positions 2 and 1 (18 and 20). Since 20 is greater than 18, set the heap property as true.
* Move up to the parent node (1) and compare the values at positions 1 and 2 (20 and 18). Since 20 is greater than 18, set the heap property as true.
* Continue this process until the root node is reached.

**Important Points:**

* The bottom-up heap construction method ensures that the heap property is satisfied at each step.
* The algorithm starts from the last non-leaf node and moves up to the root node.
* The heap property is checked at each node by comparing the values at positions k and j (left child and right child, respectively).
* If the value at position k is not greater than the value at position j, the values are swapped to satisfy the heap property.

### 5. Heap Tree Representation

**5. Heap Tree Representation**

A heap tree is a binary tree with keys assigned to its nodes, satisfying the following two conditions:

* **Shape Requirement**: The binary tree is essentially complete, meaning all levels are full except possibly the last level, where only some rightmost leaves may be missing.
* **Parental Dominance Requirement**: The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children. (This condition is considered automatically satisfied for all leaves.)

**Properties of Heap Tree Representation**

• There exists exactly one essentially complete binary tree with n nodes, with a height equal to ⌊log2n⌋.
• The root of a heap always contains its largest element.
• A node of a heap considered with all its descendants is also a heap.
• A heap can be implemented as an array by recording its elements in the top-down, left-to-right fashion.
• The parental node keys will be in the first ⌊n/2⌋ positions of the array.

**Heap Tree Construction**

* The heap tree construction process involves building a complete binary tree with n nodes, where n is the number of elements in the heap.
* The process can be done using either a bottom-up or top-down approach.

**Bottom-Up Approach**

* Start with a single node, which is the root of the heap.
* Add nodes to the heap in a level-by-level manner, ensuring that each node is greater than or equal to its children.
* The heap is constructed by recursively adding nodes to the heap, starting from the bottom and moving up.

**Top-Down Approach**

* Start with an empty heap and add nodes to it one by one.
* For each new node, perform a heapify operation to ensure that the node is inserted in the correct position in the heap.
* The heapify operation involves comparing the new node with its parent and children, and shifting the node up or down the heap as necessary to maintain the heap property.

Note: The top-down approach is often used in practice because it is more efficient and easier to implement than the bottom-up approach.

### 6. Applications of Heap Data Structure

**6. Applications of Heap Data Structure**

Heaps are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and their applications are diverse and widespread. Here are some of the key applications of heap data structures:

**Priority Queue Applications**

* Heaps are used to implement priority queues, where elements are ordered based on their priority.
* This is particularly useful in situations where elements need to be processed in a specific order, such as scheduling tasks or allocating resources.
* Heaps can be used to implement priority queues in various algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.

**Sorting Algorithms**

* Heaps are used in sorting algorithms, such as heap sort, to sort elements in a specific order.
* Heap sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses a heap data structure to sort elements in O(n log n) time complexity.
* Heaps can also be used in other sorting algorithms, such as merge sort and quick sort, to improve their efficiency.

**Graph Algorithms**

* Heaps are used in graph algorithms, such as shortest path algorithms, to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* Heaps can be used to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm, which are used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

**Other Applications**

* Heaps are used in various other applications, such as:
	+ Event handling in operating systems
	+ Resource allocation in networks
	+ Scheduling in real-time systems
	+ Data compression

**Efficiency of Heap Data Structure**

* Heaps can be used to implement efficient algorithms for various tasks, such as sorting, searching, and priority queue operations.
* The efficiency of heap data structures is due to their ability to maintain the heap property, which ensures that the parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.

**Time Complexity**

* The time complexity of heap operations, such as insertion and deletion, is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.
* The time complexity of heap sort is O(n log n), making it an efficient sorting algorithm.

**Space Complexity**

* The space complexity of heap data structures is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.
* This is because each element in the heap requires a fixed amount of space to store its key and child pointers.

In conclusion, heap data structures are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and their applications are diverse and widespread. Heaps can be used to implement priority queues, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and other applications, and their efficiency is due to their ability to maintain the heap property.
