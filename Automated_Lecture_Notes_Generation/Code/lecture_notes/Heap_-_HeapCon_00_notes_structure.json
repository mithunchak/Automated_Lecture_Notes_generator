For instance, the topmost binary tree in Slide 4 is not a heap because it does not meet the shape requirement.\n* A binary tree is not considered a heap if it does not satisfy the parental dominance requirement. For instance, the topmost binary tree in Slide 4 is not a heap because it does not meet the parental dominance requirement.\n\n**Properties of Heap:**\n\n* There exists exactly one essentially complete binary tree with n nodes. Its height is equal to \u230alog2n\u230b.\n* The root of a heap always contains its largest element.\n* A node of a heap considered with all its descendants is also a heap.\n* A heap can be implemented as an array by recording its elements in the top-down, left-to-right fashion.\n\n**Representation of Heap:**\n\n* In such a representation, the parental node keys will be in the first \u230an/2\u230b positions of the array."

      "content": "**3. Implementation of Heap**\n\n**Definition:** A heap is a binary tree with keys assigned to its nodes, satisfying the following two conditions:\n\n* **Shape Requirement:** The binary tree is essentially complete, meaning all levels are full except possibly the last level, where only some rightmost leaves may be missing.\n* **Parental Dominance Requirement:** The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children.\n\n**Properties of Heap:**\n\n\u2022 There exists exactly one essentially complete binary tree with n nodes, with a height equal to \u230alog2n\u230b.\n\u2022 The root of a heap always contains its largest element.\n\u2022 A node of a heap considered with all its descendants is also a heap.\n\u2022 A heap can be implemented as an array by recording its elements in the top-down, left-to-right fashion.\n\n**Implementation of Heap:**\n\nThe implementation of a heap involves rearranging a given sequence of elements to form a descending heap. This is done by comparing each node with its children and swapping them if necessary, to ensure the parental dominance requirement is satisfied.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Start with the root node (k = 4) and compare it with its children.\n2. If the root node has only one child, compare it with that child and ensure the parental dominance requirement is satisfied.\n3. If the root node has two children, compare them and determine which one has a higher value. Swap the root node with the child having the higher value.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each node in the tree, working from top to bottom and left to right.\n5. Once the heap is constructed, the array will contain the elements in a descending heap order.\n\n**Example:**\n\nInitially, the array contains the elements:\n\n37, 33, 48, 12, 57, 25, 92, 86\n\nAfter implementing the heap, the array becomes:\n\n92, 57, 86, 37, 33, 48, 25, 12\n\n**Note:** The heap is constructed by rearranging the elements to satisfy the parental dominance requirement, ensuring that each node is greater than or equal to its children."

      "title": "4. Heap Construction - Bottom Up",
      "content": "**4. Heap Construction - Bottom Up**\n\n**Definition:** Bottom-up heap construction is a method of constructing a heap from a given array of elements. It starts from the last non-leaf node and moves up to the root node, ensuring that the heap property is satisfied at each step.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Heap Property:** The key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys at its children.\n* **Parental Node:** A node that has children.\n* **Left Child:** The left child of a node is at position 2k, where k is the parent node's position.\n* **Right Child:** The right child of a node is at position 2k+1, where k is the parent node's position.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Start from the last non-leaf node (n/2) and move up to the root node (1).\n2. For each node, check if it has a left child (2k <= n) and a right child (2k+1 <= n).\n3. If the node has a left child and a right child, compare the values at positions k and j (left child and right child, respectively).\n4. If the value at position k is greater than the value at position j, set the heap property as true.\n5. If the value at position k is not greater than the value at position j, swap the values at positions k and j.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the root node is reached.\n\n**Formula:** The height of the heap (h) is equal to \u230alog2n\u230b.\n\n**Example:** Given an array of elements 18, 20, 25, 18, and 25, construct a heap using the bottom-up approach.\n\n* Start from the last non-leaf node (n/2 = 2).\n* Compare the values at positions 2 and 1 (18 and 20). Since 20 is greater than 18, set the heap property as true.\n* Move up to the parent node (1) and compare the values at positions 1 and 2 (20 and 18). Since 20 is greater than 18, set the heap property as true.\n* Continue this process until the root node is reached.\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n* The bottom-up heap construction method ensures that the heap property is satisfied at each step.\n* The algorithm starts from the last non-leaf node and moves up to the root node.\n* The heap property is checked at each node by comparing the values at positions k and j (left child and right child, respectively).\n* If the value at position k is not greater than the value at position j, the values are swapped to satisfy the heap property."
