We have seen that iterative inorder traversal requires an explicit stack, which can be costly and leads to losing track of addresses as we navigate the tree. By modifying the Binary Search Tree structure, we can eliminate the use of an explicit stack and create a more efficient traversal mechanism."

Threaded Binary Search Tree**\n\n**Definition:** A threaded binary search tree is a binary search tree where the right pointer of a node is used to point to the inorder successor of the node, if it exists. This allows for efficient inorder traversal without the need for an explicit stack.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n* Iterative inorder traversal requires explicit stack, which can be costly.\n* Node addresses are stacked, making it difficult to track.\n* A small structural modification to the binary tree can solve this problem.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Right-In Threaded Binary Tree:** A tree where the right pointer of a node points to the inorder successor of the node, if it exists.\n* **Left-In Threaded Binary Tree:** A tree where the left pointer of a node points to the inorder predecessor of the node, if it exists.\n* **In Threaded Binary Tree:** A tree where both the left and right pointers are used to point to the inorder predecessor and successor, respectively.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n* Inorder traversal of a threaded binary search tree visits nodes in the same order as an inorder traversal of the original binary tree.\n* The right pointer of a node points to the inorder successor of the node, if it exists.\n* The left pointer of a node points to the inorder predecessor of the node, if it exists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* In the example given, the nodes with right pointers (A, C, E, H, and I) are used to store the inorder successors.\n* The right pointer of node A points to node B, which is the inorder successor of A.\n* Similarly, the right pointer of node C points to node D, and so on.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* How to differentiate between a right thread and a child node: An additional flag field can be used to indicate whether the right pointer points to a child or a thread.\n* How to handle the case where the right pointer points to a child node: In this case, the thread is treated as a new tree, and the inorder traversal is started again.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThreaded binary search trees offer an efficient way to perform inorder traversal without the need for an explicit stack. By using the right pointer to point to the inorder successor, we can eliminate the need for explicit stack and reduce the cost of traversal."
