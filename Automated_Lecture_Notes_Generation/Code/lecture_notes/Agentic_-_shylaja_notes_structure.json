      "content": "**1. Introduction to Agentic Workflow**\n\n**Definition:** Agentic workflow refers to a workflow that involves the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a compounded manner to generate a better response to a query. This workflow does not necessarily mean that all pieces are LLMs, but rather that multiple modules, including LLMs, can be used to generate a better response.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Compounded LLM:** A workflow that involves multiple LLMs working together to generate a better response.\n* **Agent Workflow:** A workflow that uses multiple modules, including LLMs, to generate a better response.\n* **Orchestration Agent:** An agent that decides how many times the workflow needs to be repeated, what changes need to be brought in, and what all needs to be fed into the system.\n\n**Characteristics of Agentic Workflow:**\n\n* **Iterative Process:** The workflow involves multiple iterations, where the output from one LLM is fed into another LLM or a different module.\n* **Multi-Path Flow:** The workflow does not necessarily follow a linear path, but rather involves multiple paths and modules working together.\n* **Goal-Oriented:** The primary goal of the agentic workflow is to generate a better response to a query.\n\n**Advantages of Agentic Workflow:**\n\n* **Improved Response Quality:** The use of multiple LLMs and modules can lead to improved response quality and accuracy.\n* **Increased Flexibility:** The workflow can be customized to suit different applications and use cases.\n* **Enhanced Collaboration:** The use of multiple modules and LLMs can facilitate enhanced collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n**Example:** In an agentic workflow, a user may ask an LLM to generate a draft marketing plan for a product. The output from this LLM is then fed into a critic LLM, which provides feedback on the draft. The output from the critic LLM is then fed into a third LLM, which generates a refined draft. This process can be repeated multiple times to generate a final response.\n\n**Formula/Algorithm:** None mentioned in this section.\n\n**Example Code:** None mentioned in this section.\n\n**References:** None mentioned in this section."

      "content": "**3. Orchestration Agent and Agentic Workflow**\n\nThe orchestration agent plays a crucial role in the agentic workflow, enabling the efficient processing of tasks by identifying the relevant agent responsible for completing each task. In this context, an agent refers to a software component or module that performs a specific function or task.\n\n**Definition of Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Agent:** A software component or module that performs a specific function or task.\n* **Orchestration Agent:** An agent responsible for identifying the relevant agent responsible for completing each task and coordinating their actions.\n* **Agentic Workflow:** A workflow that utilizes agents to perform specific tasks, with the orchestration agent coordinating their actions.\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n* The orchestration agent acts as a bridge between the LLM and the specific agents responsible for completing tasks.\n* The orchestration agent identifies the relevant agent responsible for completing each task based on the input received from the LLM.\n* The orchestration agent coordinates the actions of the agents to ensure efficient processing of tasks.\n* The agentic workflow is not limited to LLMs; it can be applied to any software development project that involves multiple agents working together.\n\n**Example:**\n\n* In the example provided, the orchestration agent identified the question as related to cricket and passed it to the cricket agent, which fetched data from its own cricket database and produced an answer.\n* The orchestration agent then passed the answer back to the LLM, which produced the final output.\n\n**Planning Pattern:**\n\n* The planning pattern involves identifying the necessary steps required to complete a task, such as planning the layout of a room for a robot to clean.\n* The planner agent is responsible for planning the subtasks involved in carrying out the global task.\n* The planner agent makes decisions about the sequence of actions and the resources required to complete the task.\n\n**Recognition Agent:**\n\n* The recognition agent is responsible for identifying objects or patterns in an image or video, such as recognizing a boy in an image.\n* The recognition agent may use machine learning models, such as yellow or open pose, to detect the pose of the person.\n\n**Open Pose Agent:**\n\n* The open pose agent detects the pose of the person in an image or video.\n* The open pose agent may use machine learning models to identify the pose of the person.\n\n**Fusion Agent:**\n\n* The fusion agent combines the output of the recognition agent and the open pose agent to generate the final output.\n* The fusion agent makes decisions about how to combine the outputs of the recognition agent and the open pose agent.\n\n**Decision Making:**\n\n* Decision making is involved in the planning pattern, as the planner agent makes decisions about the sequence of actions and the resources required to complete the task.\n* Decision making is also involved in the fusion agent, as it makes decisions about how to combine the outputs of the recognition agent and the open pose agent."
